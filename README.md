# cava-wsl

dotfiles for a Debian WSL instance that I run `cava` under using [`winscap.exe`](https://github.com/quantum5/winscap)

## Contents:

- `install.sh` - to be run in a fresh WSL instance to setup `cava` etc
- `launch.sh` - used to launch `cava` and `winscap`

## Dependancies:

*these will be installed by `install.sh`*

- `cava`
- `winscap` (in Windows host)
- `git`
- `gh` (sometimes known as `github-cli`)
- `wget`
- `tmux` (optional)
